After an 8 month effort, we are wrapping up the 2017 NCDH Qu(h)ackathon project!

We have produced two snazzy harvest data webpages with dynamic data visualizations and two videos on waterfowl identification using wings.

Demo pages found here:  thoufer.github.io/harvestVis_demo/index.html

The content will soon be available on the Migratory Bird web site. We will update this page when that has occurred.

**THANK YOU** to everyone who participated!!  Nate, Alli, Theo, Paul, Pam, Derek, Rob, Becky, Tony x 2, Jenn, Khristi, Bob, Kathy, Chris, Meghan.

What have we learned?

1. Preparation and focus are key. We knew this going in to the effort, but the lesson was reiterated.  The project's success depends on having a well defined problem or project in mind, and benefits from a clear understanding of who the audience is .... For future "data visualization" projects, we would recommend some pre-hackathon data exploration or, if the hackathon will include enough people with data visualization skills, some specific ideas to graph/plot during the hackathon.  Some time and effort would have been saved if we had a better sense of both the data and the graphics going in to the hacakthon.

2. Extending the project beyond the hackathon itself, and developing a final project, requires a project manager/cat herder of some sort to keep the project moving forward and the group meeting regularly.

3. We need an easier way to update data for visualizations.

*What else?* Please add your thoughts ....
